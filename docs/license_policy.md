# License and Source Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the licensing and source policy for the Heidi AutoTrain pipeline and its generated artifacts.

## Project License

**MIT License** - See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

This applies to:
- Pipeline scripts (`scripts/*.py`, `scripts/*.sh`)
- Configuration files
- Documentation

## Generated Data License

**Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0)**

Generated datasets are licensed under CC-BY-4.0, meaning:
- You can share, copy, and redistribute
- You can give appropriate credit
- You can adapt, transform, and build upon

### Attribution

When using generated data, include:
```
Dataset generated by Heidi AutoTrain Pipeline

```

## Source Code Usage Policy

### Base Models

Base models used for fine-tuning are subject to their respective licenses:
- Microsoft Phi-2: [Microsoft Research License](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2)
- Meta Llama: [Llama 2 Community License](https://ai.meta.com/llama/license/)
- Other models: Check HuggingFace model cards

**Important**: Fine-tuned adapters inherit base model restrictions.

### Teacher Models

When using API-based teacher models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.):
- Follow their Terms of Service
- Do not use to generate content that violates their policies
- Check rate limits and pricing

## Data Source Policy

### Input Data

- **Synthetic-first**: Default mode uses only synthetic data
- **No real code**: Generated code snippets are synthetic
- **No external sources**: Default templates are original

### Optional External Data

If you modify the pipeline to use real code:
1. Ensure you have rights to use the source
2. Comply with source repository licenses
3. Remove any copyrighted sections
4. Add proper attribution

## Secret Handling

### Detection

The pipeline uses fail-closed secret detection:
- API keys (AWS, GitHub, OpenAI, etc.)
- Private keys (SSH, PGP)
- Database connection strings
- Passwords and tokens

Any sample with detected secrets is **automatically dropped**.

### Prevention

- Never pass real credentials to the pipeline
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Review outputs before sharing

## Export Controls

### Public Sharing

Generated datasets can be safely shared publicly because:
- All data is synthetic
- No real secrets are included
- CC-BY-4.0 license permits sharing

### Adapter Weights

Fine-tuned adapters:
- Are derived from base models
- Should follow base model license for redistribution
- May require additional licensing for commercial use

## Compliance Checklist

Before sharing or publishing:

- [ ] Reviewed base model license
- [ ] Removed any real credentials
- [ ] Verified no secrets in outputs
- [ ] Added appropriate attribution
- [ ] Checked export control regulations

## Disclaimer

This pipeline is provided "as is" without warranty. Users are responsible for:
- Ensuring their use complies with applicable laws
- Verifying output quality and safety
- Obtaining necessary licenses for commercial use
